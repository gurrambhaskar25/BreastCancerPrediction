## Breast Cancer Prediction

PROBLEM STATEMENT
The aim of this project is to diagnose patients with breast cancer by analysing the data of patients and
classifying them into two categories, having diagnosis results as
1. Benign (B)
2. Malignant (M)


LIBRARIES USED
1. NUMPY - The fundamental package for scientific computing in python
2. PANDAS – An open source BSD-licenced library providing high-performance, easy-to-use
data structures and data analysis tools for python programming language
3. SKLEARN.MODEL_SELECTION –
 Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets  Selecting optimal features
4. MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT – Provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework
5. SEABORN – It is a data visualisation library based on matplotlib. It provides high – level
interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. 6. SKLEARN.METRICS
 Accuracy score : In multilabel classification, this function computes subset
accuracy; the set of labels predicted for a sample must exactly match the
corresponding set of labels in y
 Confusion matrix : Compute confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of
classification

-DETAILS OF DATA:
The dataset was collected from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
No of rows : 569
No of columns : 33


TASKS PERFORMED:
1. Exploratory data analysis
a) Visualization
b) Mapping string to numeric data
c) Checking for duplicate values
d) Data Cleaning
2. Questions asked on the dataset with answers
a) What is the average area of a tumour of a person having cancer?
b) How does the area of tumour impact diagnosis?
c) How does radius impact diagnosis results?
3. Feature Selection
a) Using Feature Importance
b) Using Correlation heatmap
4. Normalising data
5. Ensemble Machine Learning Modelling
a) K Nearest Neighbors Classifier
b) Random Forest Classifier
c) Support Vector Classifier
6. Accuracy Calculation
7. Summary


Conclusion :-
In this way, I have performed data analysis and have checked the accuracy of 3 different classification algorithm
namely KNN, Random Forest and SVM. We Got Best Accuracy
